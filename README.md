# CsvReadCollections
This is a CSV Read and Write  Visual Studio 2019 project that serves a basic purpose but can be manipulated with little interference

This is not intended to be directly manipulated through the app itself for adding additional csv files itself just the functionality and my understanding of how these systems function to complete a simple task that involves multiple files.

There is detailed comments throughout the files to demonstrate to other people the understanding of how this C# program work.
